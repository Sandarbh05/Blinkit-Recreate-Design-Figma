# Blinkit Homepage Recreate UI (Figma)


![Blinkit Homepage UI](Home Page Recreated.png)


**Note:** This project is a *Figma UI recreation only* — no code or React implementation included. It’s a visual prototype meant for design reference, study, and portfolio showcase.


## Quick Overview
A pixel-focused recreation of Blinkit’s **mobile homepage**, designed in Figma. The prototype captures layout, spacing, components, and promotional sections (Dussehra theme) to practice real-world UI reproduction.


## What’s Inside
- **Main Page UI** — Full homepage mockup with banners, categories, and product cards.
- **Components Library** — Reusable cards, buttons, icons, and banners.
- **Style Guide** — A separate multi-section page containing:
- Custom moodboard
- Font choices, color palette, and text styles
- Design tips for consistency
- All used components and variants
- **Image Assets** — Exported thumbnails and preview images for the repo.


## How to View
1. Open the Figma prototype: [Blinkit Homepage Recreate](https://www.figma.com/design/tOQ2ZNPhVoZBHnDcabCdgS/Blinkit-Homepage-Recreate?node-id=0-1&t=Zn4JnsK5VTj4olWw-1)
2. Use **Present** mode to view the flow.
3. To reuse or edit, **Duplicate** the file into your Figma account.


## Purpose & Learnings
- Practice dissecting a production UI and rebuilding it precisely.
- Improve skills in component creation, spacing, and hierarchy.
- Understand how promotional sections and category grids perform on mobile.


## Future Ideas (Design-side)
- Create interactions in Figma (micro-interactions for seat/selection-like flows).
- Build additional pages (cart, product details) to complete the prototype.
- Prepare export-ready assets and an annotated handoff sheet for developers.
